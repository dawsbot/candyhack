IPMapper
=========
IPMapper is a terminal program which can give basic geographic analytics about a website host location as it relates to your geography. 

## Usage

Simply place the url you would like to ping in place of facebook.com in the example below:
```
$ python ipmapper.py www.facebook.com
distance from (37.4590,-122.1781) to (33.4484, -112.074)
lat1: 0.653782884505
long1: -2.13241011883
lat2: 0.583784709524
long2: -1.95606030588

Your distance from the host server: 
1016.65484283 km
631.719836343 mi
```

## Purpose
In the event you are getting a slow return of packets in your network, IPMapper can show you just how far your packets are being redirected to reach your work station.
